# ImageConverter-HEICtoJPG
Image converter from .HEIC file to .JPG format


This repsitory consists of python programming files meant for converting images of one extension to another!

Initially I created the HEIC to JPG converter to help a colleague who's using iPhone and need to upload the captured images into SharePoint.
If there's more image conversion needed in future, we will use this repo!
